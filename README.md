## Other notes
What worked: We were able to successfully call the News API in our implementation. Our frontend developed a UI around display these news articles to users. We developed a system that allows users to login, indicate their preferences on articles, save articles to their profile, etc.
<br />
Future plans: In the future, we hope to call other external APIs that will allow us to aggregate news for more countries in Africa. We also hope to implement a automatic daily call to these external news APIs to fetch headlines on a daily basis.
